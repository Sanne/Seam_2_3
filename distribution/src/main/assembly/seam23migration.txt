Seam 2.3 Migration Guide
========================
Before you get started with Seam 2.3, there are a few things you should be aware
of. This process should not be too painful - if you get stuck, just refer back
to the updated Seam examples.

This migration guide assumes you are using Seam 2.0, if you are migrating from
Seam 1.2, see the seam2migration guide as well.


Testing

SeamTest and JBoss Embedded is legacy components and have many limitations.

Schemas

XML schemas for validation Files that use the Seam 2.2 XSDs should be updated to refer to 
the 2.3 XSDs. Current Schemas URL is www.jboss.org/schema/seam/<schema>-2.3.xsd.


Cache Support - ?????
-------------


Dependency changes (Maven)
