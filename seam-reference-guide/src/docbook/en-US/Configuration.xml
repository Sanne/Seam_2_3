    <title>Configuring Seam and packaging Seam applications</title>
    <para> Configuration is a very boring topic and an extremely tedious pastime. Unfortunately, several lines of XML
        are required to integrate Seam into your JSF implementation and servlet container. There's no need to be too put
        off by the following sections; you'll never need to type any of this stuff yourself, since you can just use 
        seam-gen to start your application or you can copy and paste from the example applications! </para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Basic Seam configuration</title>

        <para> First, let's look at the basic configuration that is needed whenever we use Seam with JSF. </para>

            <para> In addition, Seam requires the following entry in your <literal>web.xml</literal> file: </para>

            <para> This listener is responsible for bootstrapping Seam, and for destroying session and application
                contexts. </para>

            <para> Some JSF implementations have a broken implementation of server-side state saving that interferes
                with Seam's conversation propagation. If you have problems with conversation propagation during form
                submissions, try switching to client-side state saving. You'll need this in <literal>web.xml</literal>: </para>

            <para>
                There is a minor gray area in the JSF specification regarding the mutability of view state values. Since
                Seam uses the JSF view state to back its PAGE scope this can become an issue in some cases. If you're
                using server side state saving with the JSF-RI and you want a PAGE scoped bean to keep its exact value
                for a given view of a page you will need to specify the following context-param. Otherwise if a user
                uses the "back" button a PAGE scoped component will have the latest value if it has changed not the
                value of the "back" page. (see
                <ulink url="https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=295">
                    Spec Issue
                </ulink>
                ). This setting is not enabled by default because of the performance hit of serializing the JSF view
                with every request.

            <para> If you want follow our advice and use Facelets instead of JSP, add the following lines to

            <para>
               If you are using facelets in JBoss AS, you'll find that Facelets logging is broken (the log messages
               don't make it to the server log). Seam provides a bridge to fix this, to use it copy
               <literal>lib/interop/jboss-seam-jul.jar</literal> to
               <literal>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/jsf-libs/</literal> and include the
               <literal>jboss-seam-ui.jar</literal> in the <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal> of your application.  The
               Facelets logging catagories are itemized in the <ulink

            <title>Seam servlet filters</title>

            <para> Seam doesn't need any servlet filters for basic operation. However, there are several features which
                depend upon the use of filters. To make things easier, Seam lets you add and configure
                servlet filters just like you would configure other built-in Seam components. To take advantage of this
                feature, we must first install a master filter in <literal>web.xml</literal>: </para>

            <para>
               The Seam filters share a number of common attributes, you can set these in

              Note that the patterns are matched against the URI path of the request (see

              removed before matching.

            <para> Adding the master filter enables the following built-in filters. </para>

            <sect3>
                <title>Exception handling</title>
                <para> This filter provides the exception mapping functionality in <literal>pages.xml</literal> (almost
                    all applications will need this). It also takes care of rolling back uncommitted transactions when
                    uncaught exceptions occur. (According to the Java EE specification, the web container should do this
                    automatically, but we've found that this behavior cannot be relied upon in all application servers.
                    And it is certainly not required of plain servlet engines like Tomcat.) </para>

                <para> By default, the exception handling filter will process all requests, however this behavior may be
                    adjusted by adding a <literal>&lt;web:exception-filter&gt;</literal> entry to
                        <literal>components.xml</literal>, as shown in this example: </para>

                <para> This filter allows Seam to propagate the conversation context across browser redirects. It
                    intercepts any browser redirects and adds a request parameter that specifies the Seam conversation
                    identifier. </para>

                <para> The redirect filter will process all requests by default, but this behavior can also be adjusted

                <title>Context management for custom servlets</title>
                <para> Requests sent direct to some servlet other than the JSF servlet are not processed through the JSF
                    lifecycle, so Seam provides a servlet filter that can be applied to any other servlet that needs
                    access to Seam components. </para>

                <para> This filter allows custom servlets to interact with the Seam contexts. It sets up the Seam
                    contexts at the beginning of each request, and tears them down at the end of the request. You should
                    make sure that this filter is <emphasis>never</emphasis> applied to the JSF
                    <literal>FacesServlet</literal>. Seam uses the phase listener for context management in a JSF
                    request. </para>

                <para> This filter is not installed by default and requires an entry in
                    <literal>components.xml</literal> to enable it: </para>

                <para> The context filter expects to find the conversation id of any conversation context in a request
                    parameter named <literal>conversationId</literal>. You are responsible for ensuring that it gets
                    sent in the request. </para>

                <para> You are also responsible for ensuring propagation of any new conversation id back to the client.
                    Seam exposes the conversation id as a property of the built in component
                    <literal>conversation</literal>. </para>

                    Seam does <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically add <literal>cache-control</literal> HTTP headers to
                    any resources served by the Seam resource servlet, or directly from your view directory by the servlet
                    container. This means that your images, Javascript and CSS files, and resource representations from
                    Seam resource servlet such as Seam Remoting Javascript interfaces are usually not cached by the browser.
                    This is convenient in development but should be changed in production when optimizing the application.

            <title>Integrating Seam with your EJB container</title>

            <para> In a Seam application, EJB components have a certain duality, as they are managed by both the EJB
                container and Seam. Actually, it's more that Seam resolves EJB component references, manages the
                lifetime of stateful session bean components, and also participates in each method call via
                interceptors. Let's start with the configuration of the Seam interceptor chain.</para>

            <para> We need to apply the <literal>SeamInterceptor</literal> to our Seam EJB components. This interceptor
                delegates to a set of built-in server-side interceptors that handle such concerns as bijection,
                conversation demarcation, and business process signals. The simplest way to do this across an entire
                application is to add the following interceptor configuration in <literal>ejb-jar.xml</literal>: </para>

            <para> Seam needs to know where to go to find session beans in JNDI. One way to do this is specify the
                    <literal>@JndiName</literal> annotation on every session bean Seam component. However, this is quite
                tedious. A better approach is to specify a pattern that Seam can use to calculate the JNDI name from the
                EJB name. Unfortunately, there is no standard mapping to global JNDI defined in the EJB3 specification,
                so this mapping is vendor-specific (and may depend on your own naming conventions as well). We usually
                specify this option in <literal>components.xml</literal>. </para>

            <para> For JBoss AS, the following pattern is correct: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<core:init jndi-name="earName/#{ejbName}/local" />]]></programlisting>

            <para> In this case, <literal>earName</literal> is the name of the EAR in which the bean is deployed, Seam
                replaces <literal>#{ejbName}</literal> with the name of the EJB, and the final segment represents the
                type of interface (local or remote). </para>

            <para> Outside the context of an EAR (when using the JBoss Embeddable EJB3 container), the first segment is
                dropped since there is no EAR, leaving us with the following pattern: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<core:init jndi-name="#{ejbName}/local" />]]></programlisting>

            <para> How these JNDI names are resolved and somehow locate an EJB component might appear a bit like black
                magic at this point, so let's dig into the details. First, let's talk about how the EJB components get
                into JNDI.</para>

            <para> The folks at JBoss don't care much for XML, if you can't tell. So when they designed JBoss AS, they
                decided that EJB components would get assigned a global JNDI name automatically, using the pattern
                just described (i.e., EAR name/EJB name/interface type). The EJB name is the first non-empty value
                from the following list: </para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The value of the <literal>&lt;ejb-name&gt;</literal> element in ejb-jar.xml</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The value of the <literal>name</literal> attribute in the @Stateless or @Stateful annotation</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The simple name of the bean class</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para> Let's look at an example. Assume that you have the following EJB bean and interface defined. </para>

            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[package com.example.myapp;

import javax.ejb.Local;

@Local
public interface Authenticator
{
    boolean authenticate();
}

package com.example.myapp;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;

@Stateless
@Name("authenticator")
public class AuthenticatorBean implements Authenticator
{ 
    public boolean authenticate() { ... }
}
]]></programlisting>

            <para> Assuming your EJB bean class is deployed in an EAR named myapp, the global JNDI name 
                myapp/AuthenticatorBean/local will be assigned to it on JBoss AS. As you learned, you can reference this
                EJB component as a Seam component with the name <literal>authenticator</literal> and Seam will take care
                of finding it in JNDI according to the JNDI pattern (or <literal>@JndiName</literal> annotation).
                </para>

            <para>So what about the rest of the application servers? Well, according to the Java EE spec, which most
                vendors try to adhere to religiously, you have to declare an EJB reference for your EJB in order for it
                to be assigned a JNDI name. That requires some XML. It also means that it is up to you to establish a
                JNDI naming convention so that you can leverage the Seam JNDI pattern. You might find the JBoss
                convention a good one to follow.</para>

            <para>There are two places you have to define the EJB reference when using Seam on non-JBoss application
                servers. If you are going to be looking up the Seam EJB component through JSF (in a JSF view or as a JSF
                action listener) or a Seam JavaBean component, then you must declare the EJB reference in web.xml. Here
                is the EJB reference for the example component just shown: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<ejb-local-ref>
    <ejb-ref-name>myapp/AuthenticatorBean/local</ejb-ref-name>
    <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>
    <local>org.example.vehicles.action.Authenticator</local>
</ejb-local-ref>
]]></programlisting>

            <para>This reference will cover most uses of the component in a Seam application. However, if you want to
                be able to inject a Seam EJB component into another Seam EJB component using <literal>@In</literal>, you
                need to define this EJB reference in another location. This time, it must be defined in ejb-jar.xml, and
                it's a bit tricker. </para>

            <para>Within the context of an EJB method call, you have to deal with a somewhat sheltered JNDI context.
                When Seam attempts to find another Seam EJB component to satisfy an injection point defined using
                <literal>@In</literal>, whether or not it finds it depends on whether an EJB reference exists in
                JNDI. Strictly speaking, you cannot simply resolve JNDI names as you please. You have to define
                the references explicitly. Fortunately, JBoss recognized how aggrevating this would be for the
                developer and all versions of JBoss automatically register EJBs so they are always available in
                JNDI, both to the web container and the EJB container. So if you are using JBoss, you can skip the next
                few paragraphs. However, if you are deploying to GlassFish, pay close attention.</para>
                
            <para>For application servers that stubbornly adhere to the EJB specification, EJB references must always be
                defined explicitly. But unlike with the web context, where a single resource reference covers all
                uses of the EJB from the web environment, you cannot declare EJB references globally in the EJB container.
                Instead, you have to specify the JNDI resources for a given EJB component one-by-one.</para>

            <para> Let's assume that we have an EJB named RegisterAction (the name is resolved using the three steps
                mentioned previously). That EJB has the following Seam injection:</para>

            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@In(create = true)
Authenticator authenticator;
]]></programlisting>

            <para> In order for this injection to work, the link must be established in the ejb-jar.xml file as follows: </para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<ejb-jar>
    <enterprise-beans>
        <session>
            <ejb-name>RegisterAction</ejb-name>
            <ejb-local-ref>
                <ejb-ref-name>myapp/AuthenticatorAction/local</ejb-ref-name>
                <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>
                <local>com.example.myapp.Authenticator</local>
            </ejb-local-ref>
        </session>
    </enterprise-beans>

    ...
    
</ejb-jar>
]]></programlisting>

            <para> Notice that the contents of the <literal>&lt;ejb-local-ref&gt;</literal> are identical to what we
                defined in web.xml. What we are doing is bringing the reference into the EJB context where it can be
                used by the RegisterAction bean. You will need to add one of these references for any injection of a
                Seam EJB compoenent into another Seam EJB component using <literal>@In</literal>. (You can see an
                example of this setup in the jee5/booking example).</para>

            <para> But what about <literal>@EJB</literal>? It's true that you can inject one EJB into another using
                <literal>@EJB</literal>. However, by doing so, you are injecting the actual EJB reference rather than the
                Seam EJB component instance. In this case, some Seam features will work, while others won't. That's
                because Seam's interceptor is invoked on any method call to an EJB component. But that only invokes
                Seam's server-side interceptor chain. What you lose is Seam's state management and Seam's client-side
                interceptor chain. Client-side interceptors handle concerns such as security and concurrency. Also, when
                injecting a SFSB, there is no guarantee that you will get the SFSB bound to the active session or
                conversation, whatever the case may be. Thus, you definitely want to inject the Seam EJB component using
                <literal>@In</literal>.</para>

            <para> That covers how JNDI names are defined and used. The lesson is that with some application servers,
                such as GlassFish, you are going to have to specify JNDI names for all EJB components explicitly, and
                sometimes twice! And even if you are following the same naming convention as JBoss AS, the JNDI pattern
                in Seam may need to be altered. For instance, the global JNDI names are automatically prefixed with
                java:comp/env on GlassFish, so you need to define the JNDI pattern as follows:</para>

            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<core:init jndi-name="java:comp/env/earName/#{ejbName}/local" />]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                Finally, let's talk about transactions. In an EJB3 environment, we recommend the use of a special
                built-in component for transaction management, that is fully aware of container transactions, and can
                correctly process transaction success events registered with the <literal>Events</literal> component. If
                you don't add this line to your <literal>components.xml</literal> file, Seam won't know when
                container-managed transactions end: </para>
            
            <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<transaction:ejb-transaction/>]]></programlisting>

        </sect2>

        <sect2>
            <title>Don't forget!</title>

            <para> There is one final item you need to know about. You must place a <literal>seam.properties</literal>,
                    <literal>META-INF/seam.properties</literal> or <literal>META-INF/components.xml</literal> file in
                any archive in which your Seam components are deployed (even an empty properties file will do). At
                startup, Seam will scan any archives with <literal>seam.properties</literal> files for seam components. </para>

            <para> In a web archive (WAR) file, you must place a <literal>seam.properties</literal> file in the
                    <literal>WEB-INF/classes</literal> directory if you have any Seam components included here. </para>

            <para> That's why all the Seam examples have an empty <literal>seam.properties</literal> file. You can't
                just delete this file and expect everything to still work! </para>

            <para> You might think this is silly and what kind of idiot framework designers would make an empty file
                affect the behavior of their software?? Well, this is a workaround for a limitation of the
                JVM &#8212; if we didn't use this mechanism, our next best option would be to force you to list every
                component explicitly in <literal>components.xml</literal>, just like some other competing frameworks do!

        <title>Configuring Seam in J2EE</title>

        <para> Seam is useful even if you're not yet ready to take the plunge into EJB 3.0. In this case you would use
            Hibernate3 or JPA instead of EJB 3.0 persistence, and plain JavaBeans instead of session beans. You'll miss
            out on some of the nice features of session beans but it will be very easy to migrate to EJB 3.0 when you're
            ready and, in the meantime, you'll be able to take advantage of Seam's unique declarative state management
            architecture. </para>

        <para> Seam JavaBean components do not provide declarative transaction demarcation like session beans do. You

            annotation. But most applications will just use Seam managed transactions when using Hibernate with

        <para> The Seam distribution includes a version of the booking example application that uses Hibernate3 and
            JavaBeans instead of EJB3, and another version that uses JPA and JavaBeans. These example applications are

        <title>Configuring SFSB and Session Timeouts in JBoss AS</title>

        <para> It is very important that the timeout for Stateful Session Beans is set higher than the timeout for HTTP
            Sessions, otherwise SFSB's may time out before the user's HTTP session has ended. JBoss Application Server
            has a default session bean timeout of 30 minutes, which is configured in
                <literal>server/default/conf/standardjboss.xml</literal> (replace <emphasis>default</emphasis> with your
            own configuration). </para>

        <para> The default SFSB timeout can be adjusted by modifying the value of <literal>max-bean-life</literal> in
            the <literal>LRUStatefulContextCachePolicy</literal> cache configuration: </para>

        <para> The default HTTP session timeout can be modified in
                <literal>server/default/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/conf/web.xml</literal> for JBoss 4.0.x, or in
                <literal>server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/conf/web.xml</literal> for JBoss 4.2.x or later. The following
            entry in this file controls the default session timeout for all web applications: </para>

        <title>Running Seam in a Portlet</title>

        <para>
           If you want to run your Seam application in a portlet, take a look at
           the JBoss Portlet Bridge, an implementation of JSR-301 that supports
           JSF within a portlet, with extensions for Seam and RichFaces. See
           <ulink url="http://labs.jboss.com/portletbridge">http://labs.jboss.com/portletbridge</ulink>
           for more.

        <title>Deploying custom resources</title>
        
        <para>
            Seam scans all jars containing <literal>/seam.properties</literal>,
            <literal>/META-INF/components.xml</literal> or <literal>/META-INF/seam.properties</literal>
            on startup for resources. For example, all classes annotated with
            <literal>@Name</literal> are registered with Seam as Seam components.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            You may also want Seam to handle custom resources. A common use case
            is to handle a specific annotation and Seam provides specific 
            support for this. First, tell Seam which annotations to handle in
            <literal>/META-INF/seam-deployment.properties</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[# A colon-separated list of annotation types to handle
org.jboss.seam.deployment.annotationTypes=com.acme.Foo:com.acme.Bar]]></programlisting>
         
        <para>
            Then, during application startup you can get hold of all classes
            annotated with <literal>@Foo</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Name("fooStartup")
@Scope(APPLICATION)
@Startup
public class FooStartup {

   @In("#{deploymentStrategy.annotatedClasses['com.acme.Foo']}")
   private Set<Class<Object>> fooClasses;
   
   @In("#{hotDeploymentStrategy.annotatedClasses['com.acme.Foo']}")
   private Set<Class<Object>> hotFooClasses;

   @Create
   public void create() {
      for (Class clazz: fooClasses) {
         handleClass(clazz);
      }
      for (Class clazz: hotFooClasses) {
         handleClass(clazz);
      }
   }
   
   public void handleClass(Class clazz) {
       // ...
   }

}]]></programlisting>

        <para>    
            You can also handle <emphasis>any</emphasis> resource. For example, 
            you process any files with the extension <literal>.foo.xml</literal>.
            To do this, we need to write a custom deployment handler:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[public class FooDeploymentHandler implements DeploymentHandler {
    private static DeploymentMetadata FOO_METADATA = new DeploymentMetadata()
    {

        public String getFileNameSuffix() {
            return ".foo.xml";
        }
    };
    
   public String getName() {
      return "fooDeploymentHandler";
   }

    public DeploymentMetadata getMetadata() {
        return FOO_METADATA;
    }
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Here we are just building a list of any files with the suffix 
            <literal>.foo.xml</literal>. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Then, we need to register the deployment handler with Seam in
            <literal>/META-INF/seam-deployment.properties</literal>.  
            You can register multiple deployment handler using a comma 
            separated list.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[# For standard deployment
org.jboss.seam.deployment.deploymentHandlers=com.acme.FooDeploymentHandler

         <para>

         </para>
         
         <para>
             Seam uses deployment handlers internally to install components and
             namespaces. You can easily access the deployment handler during an 
             <literal>APPLICATION</literal> scoped component's startup:
