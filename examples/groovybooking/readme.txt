Seam GroovyBooking Example
==========================

This is the Hotel Booking example implemented in Groovy Beans and Hibernate JPA.
This application runs on JBoss AS, but is deployed as a WAR rather than an EAR.
Thus, you prefix all the typical targets (explode, restart, unexplode) with
"jbosswar." (e.g., jbosswar.explode, jbosswar.restart, jbosswar.unexplode).

Please note that you need to set the loadPersistenceUnits property to "true"
in build.properties when deploying to JBoss AS 4.

When editing Groovy files from the src/action directory, you can run ant
"jbosswar.explode" to see your changes take effect.  When editing Groovy files
from src/model, you need to run "ant jbosswar.explode jbosswar.restart"

Access the application at http://localhost:8080/jboss-seam-groovybooking
