Seam Metawidget DVD Store Example
=================================

This example demonstrates the use of Seam with jBPM pageflow and business
process management. It uses metawidget to dynamically generate the forms at
runtime. The example runs on JBoss AS as an EAR and Tomcat with Embedded JBoss
as a WAR.

example.name=dvdstore

The source files in this example are just the overrides needed to utilize
metawidget. Before the example is built, these overrides are merged with the
original dvdstore source code in a staging directory. This step is performed
by following command:

  ant stage

The stage command is automatically called on any Ant build, so you can simply run:

  ant explode

Access the application at http://localhost:8080/seam-metawidget-dvdstore

For further Metawidget documentation see http://metawidget.org/documentation.html.

Notice: Deployment into JBoss AS 6 requires to use Hibernate-Search 3.3 and this 
can be done through launching 

	ant -f build-jboss6.xml
