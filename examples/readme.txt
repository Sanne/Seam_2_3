Seam Example Applications
=========================
This directory contains the Seam example applications, which have all been
tested on the latest release of JBoss 4.2. All but a few examples have been
tested on Tomcat (running JDK 1.5), and some have been tested on other
application servers. Consult the readme.txt file in each of the examples to
see which additional servers the example supports.

Below is a list of examples with a brief description. The name of the example,
refered to later as ${example.name}, is equivalent to the name of the folder
unless the folder name begins with seam, in which case the prefix "seam" is
omitted (i.e. seamspace -> space).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are just getting started with Seam, it's highly recommended that you
study the jee5/booking example first. This example is designed to run
unmodified on a Java EE 5-compliant application server. Of course, the real
world is never so ideal. Therefore, you'll find modifications that you need to
make for various application servers in the example's readme.txt file. These
instructions can also be found in the Seam reference documentation.

Deploying and Testing an Example Application
============================================

These are general instructions for deploying Seam examples. Take a look at the 
readme.txt in the example to see if there are any specific instructions.

How to Build and Deploy an Example on JBoss AS
----------------------------------------------

1. Download and unzip JBoss AS 4.2.3.GA from:
   
   http://jboss.org/jbossas/downloads

2. Make sure you have an up to date version of Seam: 

   http://seamframework.org/Download

3. Open the "build.properties" file at the root of the Seam distribution in
   your editor and change jboss.home to point to your JBoss AS directory
   (the examples are deployed to the default profile)

4. (Optional) Build Seam by running "ant" the Seam root directory
   Only required if you are working from an SVN checkout.

5. Build and deploy the example by running the following command from the Seam
   "examples/${example.name}" directory:
   
   ant explode
   
   To undeploy the example, run:

   ant unexplode

   To restart the deployed application, run:

   ant restart

6. Start JBoss AS by typing "./run.sh" (on Linux/Unix) or "run" (on Windows) 
   in the jboss-4.2.3.GA/bin directory

7. Point your web browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/seam-${example.name}

   Recall that ${example.name} is the name of the example folder unless the
   folder begins with seam, in which the prefix "seam" is omitted. The
   context path is set in META-INF/application.xml for EAR deployments.

   However, WAR deployments use a different naming convention for the context
   path. If you deploy a WAR example, point your web browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/jboss-seam-${example.name}

   The WAR examples are groovybooking, jpa, hibernate, and spring

NOTE: The examples use the HSQL database embedded in JBoss AS


How to Build and Deploy the Example on Tomcat
---------------------------------------------

1. Download and install Tomcat 6

   NOTE: Due to a bug, you must install Tomcat to a directory
   path with no spaces. The example does not work in a default
   install of Tomcat.
   
2. Install Embedded JBoss as described in the "Configuration" chapter of the
   Seam reference documentation. 
   
3. Make sure you have an up to date version of Seam: 

   http://seamframework.org/Download

4. Open the "build.properties" file at the root of the Seam distribution in
   your editor and change tomcat.home to point to your Tomcat directory

5. (Optional) Build Seam by running "ant" the Seam root directory
   Only required if you are working from an SVN checkout.

6. Build and deploy the example by running the following command from the Seam
   "examples/${example.name}" directory:
   
   ant tomcat.deploy
   
   To undeploy the example, run:

   ant tomcat.undeploy

   To redeploy/restart the deployed application, run:

   ant tomcat.deploy

7. Start Tomcat

8. Point your web browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/jboss-seam-${example.name}
   
   Note that examples deployed to Tomcat use the context path prefix
   jboss-seam- rather than seam- like with the JBoss AS deployment.

   
Running The TestNG Tests
------------------------

In the "examples/${example.name}" directory, type "ant test"


Running the TestNG Tests in Eclipse
-----------------------------------

1. Install the TestNG Eclipse plugin from http://beust.com/eclipse

2. Create the TestNG runner with the following directories added to the
   classpath:
   
   examples/${example.name}/src/
   examples/${example.name}/resources/
   bootstrap/
   
   And all jar files from the following directories in your classpath:
   
   lib/test
   
   Make sure all these come before the referenced libraries
   
3. Locate and run the testng.xml file using the TestNG plugin
